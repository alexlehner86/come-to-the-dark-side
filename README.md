# Project "Come To The Dark Side"

What does it feel like to be blind? How can you navigate a website and read the content? Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness. If you're not one of them, now is your chance to put yourselves in their shoes!

This project wants to enable all users to experience a website without visual input, relying only on the feedback a screen reader provides. Turn everything black via the "Go Dark" button and experience the website as a blind user would. Check out the [live version](https://alexlehner86.github.io/come-to-the-dark-side/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5 and later updated to Angular version 13.3.2.
